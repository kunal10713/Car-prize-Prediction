# Car-prize-Prediction
This project is to create a machine learning model which can provide accurate insight
on predicting price of used cars (second hand cars) using a given dataset. We are going to
predicting the selling price from the present price based on the features age of cars and some
other features. This design document presents the designs used or intended to be used in
implementing the project.
