  # Car-prize-Prediction
</div>

This project is to create a machine learning model which can provide accurate insight
on predicting price of used cars (second hand cars) using a given dataset. Created model is going to predicting the selling price from the present price based on the features age of cars and some other features.

## Dataset
<b>Dataset Link:</b> https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho <br>
This dataset contains information about used cars.
This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.
The columns in the given dataset are as follows:

1. name
2. year
3. selling_price
4. km_driven
5. fuel
6. seller_type
7. transmission
8. Owner
<br>

## Steps for running in local computer
**STEP-1:** Install all the dependencies mentioned in **requirements.txt** file. You can run the following command in your command prompt to install all the dependencies:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**STEP-2:** After installing all the dependencies, open command prompt from the direction where app.py file is present and run the following command:

```python
python app.py
```
That's it, you can see the web application running at you localhost.<br>
